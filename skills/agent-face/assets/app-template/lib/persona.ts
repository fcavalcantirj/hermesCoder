// The default FACE persona — the system prompt that turns any brain into a
// voice-and-face agent. It is deliberately GENERIC (no Hermes / Claude / vendor
// wording) so it works identically across every Mode A and Mode B brain.
//
// Two things every reply must respect:
//   1. It will be SPOKEN aloud (TTS) and lip-synced, so answers stay short,
//      plain, and free of markdown / code fences / emoji / URLs that sound
//      wrong read out loud.
//   2. The face can EMOTE. The model may optionally emit a single
//      `[[face:<emotion>]]` directive (from the 12-emotion vocabulary) to steer
//      expression; the client strips it before speaking (see
//      `lib/face/emotion-machine.ts`).
